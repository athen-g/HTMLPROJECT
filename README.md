# My actual first project

If you've seen my initial project you know why this says "actual" first projecct.
For those who haven't, here's the link [https://github.com/athen-g/HTMLTUTORIAL.git]
Now, what is this project about?
I'm planning to create a coding learning resources website.
My basic aims for this project:
    1. Make a sign up page.
    2. Make the home page for learning resources site.
    3. For the actual resources, make a pade with links to YouTube videos.
        Side note for myself, a lot of ateention should be put in the presentation.
    4. On the home page, make a table to show the various topics covered.
For now, this is it.
If any change of plans are made for this project, they will be added to this README file.

See ya.
