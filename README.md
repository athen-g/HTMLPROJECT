# My actual first project

If you've seen my initial project you know why this says "actual" first projecct.<br>
For those who haven't, <a href="https://github.com/athen-g/HTMLTUTORIAL.git">here's</a> the link.<br>
Now, what is this project about?<br>
I'm planning to create a coding learning resources website.<br>
My basic aims for this project:<br>
<ol>
    <li>
        Make a sign up page.
    </li>
    <li>
        Make the home page for learning resources site.
    </li>
    <li>
        For the actual resources, make a pade with links to YouTube videos.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Side note for myself, a lot of ateention should be put in the presentation.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        On the home page, make a table to show the various topics covered.
    </li>
</ol>
For now, this is it.<br>
If any change of plans are made for this project, they will be added to this README file.
