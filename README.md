# My actual first project

If you've seen my initial project you know why this says "actual" first projecct.<br>
For those who haven't, <a href="https://github.com/athen-g/HTMLTUTORIAL.git">here's</a> the link.<br>
Now, what is this project about?<br>
I'm planning to create a coding learning resources website.<br>
My basic aims for this project:<br>
<ol>
    <li>
        Make a sign up page.
    </li>
    <li>
        Make the home page for learning resources site.
    </li>
    <li>
        For the actual resources, make a pade with links to YouTube videos.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Side note for myself, a lot of ateention should be put in the presentation.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <s>On the home page, make a table to show the various topics covered.</s>
    </li>
</ol>
For now, this is it.<br>
If any change of plans are made for this project, they will be added to this README file.
<br><br>
See ya.

Welcome Back!

I have decided to end this project.<br>
I think I have more or less achived what I wanted to do.<br>
I shall move onto CSS now.
The more of these projects I do the more I become less of a perfectionst (That's a good thing).<br>
I don't really have anything more to say here.<br>
I did learn a few things that I have learnt and I have mentioned it in CHANGELONG.md.<br>
This is it.<br>
This is the end of the project.<br>
I shall see you guys in a new project.<br>
One with CSS.<br>

Goodbye.
