        Comments:
        <ul>
            I can't seem to figure out how to put these videos in one line without using CSS.<br>
            I want to make this project using 100% HTML.<br>
            I think I'll have to put them in a table to do that.<br>
            Which means I'll have to rewrite the whole code.<br>
            I don't like where this is going.<br>
